    "\n",
    "A black hole is a region of space where gravity is so strong that nothing—not even light—can escape from it. This immense gravitational pull arises when a large amount of mass is compressed into an extremely small area. At the center of a black hole lies the singularity, a point where density becomes infinite and the known laws of physics break down.

    "Most black holes form from the remnants of massive stars. When such a star exhausts its nuclear fuel, it can no longer support itself against gravity and collapses inward, triggering a supernova explosion. If the remaining core is sufficiently massive, it collapses completely, forming a black hole. In addition to these stellar-mass black holes, scientists have discovered supermassive black holes—millions or even billions of times more massive than the Sun—at the centers of most galaxies.\"\"\""
